I have written the code for a chat bot that can engage in voice-based conversations using the Python language. Several libraries and modules were used to implement this project. Here are some of the key features of the project:

OpenAI: I integrated ChatGPT, a language model based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture. This allows the bot to provide realistic and meaningful responses.

SpeechRecognition: I used the SpeechRecognition library to convert the user's speech into text. This enables users to interact with the bot naturally through speech instead of typing.

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): I utilize gTTS to provide the bot's responses in an audio format. This allows you to listen to the bot's spoken replies.

pydub and AudioSegment: I employed the pydub and AudioSegment modules to play audio files. This enhances the experience of listening to the bot's spoken responses.

Additionally, the project uses a file named API_KEY to store the OpenAI API key, which is kept outside of the project for security purposes.

With the chat bot, you can ask questions, engage in conversations, and receive responses in real-time. Developing a bot that can understand user speech and generate meaningful replies is a great accomplishment.
